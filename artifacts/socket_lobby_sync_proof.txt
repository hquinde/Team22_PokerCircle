Socket.IO Lobby Sync — Proof of Working

Instructions:
1. Start backend:   cd backend && npm run dev
2. Start frontend:  cd frontend && npm start
3. Log in on two simulator instances (or two devices on the same local network).
4. Both navigate to JoinSession and enter the same 6-char session code.
5. Confirm both land on LobbyScreen and see each other's names appear live.
6. Copy the server stdout below (showing both joins and both lobby:update emits).
7. Navigate away from LobbyScreen on one device — confirm clean disconnect in logs.
